# Library Management System (LMS)

## Overview
This Django-based Library Management System (LMS) facilitates book borrowing and management for students and administrators. Its primary purpose is to streamline the library's operations, offering students an intuitive platform to browse and request books, while providing administrators with robust tools for inventory management, user administration, and borrow request approvals. The system aims to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and improve the overall library experience.

## System Architecture
The LMS is built on Django 5.2.7 and utilizes a custom administrative portal alongside standard student-facing functionalities.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Theming**: A consistent purple gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2) is applied across all admin pages, complemented by book-themed loading animations.
- **Navigation**: Both student and admin interfaces feature sidebar navigation, with role-based menu items for administrators.
- **Layout**: Clean, modern card-based layouts are used for dashboards and management pages.
- **Interactivity**: All pages include a collapsible sidebar toggled by a hamburger menu, with state persistence using localStorage. Smooth CSS transitions are used for animations.
- **Sidebar Design**: Modern collapsible sidebar with gradient background, smooth cubic-bezier animations, rounded menu items with hover effects (translateX + accent bar), and active state with purple gradient. Features enhanced shadows and 0.4s transition timing. When collapsed, displays a 70px icon-only bar with centered icons and hidden text labels. Toggle button icon changes dynamically: ‚ò∞ (hamburger) when expanded, ‚Üí (arrow) when collapsed.
- **Iconography**: An icon-based UI is used for actions like Edit (‚úèÔ∏è), Delete (üóëÔ∏è), Add (‚ûï), Import (üì•), Upload (‚¨ÜÔ∏è), and Cancel (‚úñÔ∏è) to enhance visual appeal and clarity.
- **Dashboard Cards**: Admin dashboard displays stat cards for Total Students (purple), Total Books (green), Pending Requests (orange), Fine Management (red, ‚Çπ), and Total Admins (blue, superadmin only).

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Authentication**:
    - **Student**: Uses roll number for login. Password hashing is handled by Django's utilities. Logout redirects to the home page.
    - **Admin**: Custom `Admin` model with email-based authentication. Two roles: 'officer' (manages students, books, requests) and 'superadmin' (manages other admins too). Custom decorators (`@admin_login_required`, `@superadmin_required`) enforce access control. Logout redirects to the home page.
- **User Management**:
    - **Student**: Signup, login, profile management (name, phone number), and viewing borrowed books.
    - **Admin**: CRUD operations for students, books, and other admins (superadmin only).
- **Book Management**:
    - Comprehensive CRUD for books, including fields for title, author, ISBN, quantity, category, department, language, and `fine_rate`.
    - CSV Bulk Import for students and books, with validation, duplicate handling, and sample CSV downloads.
- **Borrow Request Workflow**:
    - Students can request books and select an `expected_return_date` via a confirmation modal displaying fine rates.
    - Admins approve/reject requests. Rejection requires a `reject_reason`, which is displayed to students.
    - Admins can mark approved books as returned.
    - **Fine Calculation**: Automated calculation of `fine_amount` based on overdue days and the book's `fine_rate`. Fine amounts are displayed in Rupee (‚Çπ).
- **Error Handling & Validation**:
    - Server-side form validations for student signup, login, and admin login.
    - User-friendly error messages displayed inline and on the same page for authentication failures.
- **Core Models**:
    - `Book`: Includes `language`, `fine_rate`, `category`, and `department` fields for better organization.
    - `Student`: Linked to Django's `User` model, with `roll_no`, `branch`, `name`, and `phone_number`.
    - `Borrow`: Tracks student, book, dates, status, `expected_return_date`, `fine_amount`, and `reject_reason`.
    - `Admin`: Custom model with `email`, `password`, `name`, `role`, and `is_active`.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Development Environment**: Configured for Replit, running on port 5000 with `0.0.0.0` binding.
- **Deployment**: Utilizes Gunicorn as the WSGI server for production environments, configured for Replit autoscale deployment.
- **Database**: SQLite is used for development, with a structured schema including `Book`, `Student`, `Borrow`, and `Admin` models.
- **Currency**: All monetary values, specifically fine rates, are displayed in Indian Rupees (‚Çπ).
- **Caching**: Cache control headers (no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate) are implemented on the student dashboard to prevent browser caching issues with JavaScript functionality.
- **JavaScript Architecture**: Modal-related JavaScript functions are defined before HTML elements that reference them to ensure proper availability when inline onclick handlers execute.
